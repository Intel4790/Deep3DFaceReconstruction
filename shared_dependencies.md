As the user's intent is to run the code in the repository, and we are generating a single file "./main.py", there are no shared dependencies between multiple files. However, the "./main.py" file might require certain dependencies to run the code. These dependencies could be:

1. Imported Libraries: These are the libraries that the Python script might need to run the code. For example, if the code is interacting with a database, it might need libraries like 'sqlite3' or 'psycopg2'. If it's a web scraping script, it might need 'requests' or 'beautifulsoup4'.

2. Environment Variables: These are the variables that are defined in the environment where the script runs. They could be API keys, database credentials, or any other sensitive information that shouldn't be hard-coded into the script.

3. Functions: If the script is using any functions, those function names are also dependencies. They could be built-in Python functions or user-defined functions.

4. Data Schemas: If the script is interacting with a database or an API, it might need to know the schema of the data it's working with. This could be the structure of the database tables or the format of the API responses.

Please note that without the actual code or more specific user intent, it's impossible to provide the exact names of the dependencies.
